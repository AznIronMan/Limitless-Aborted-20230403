ABOUT THIS GAME

LIMITLESS is an arena game that will be 
completely customizable.  It is a homage to 
the old school late 80's-90's RPG games, 
specifically the turn based battle.  This 
game will be completely customizable.  Some
of the features will include the ability to
"level up" your chosen character, the NPC 
players to "level up", and an option for the
game world to develop while not in game play.

This is very early development, not playable 
at this time.

This game was inspired by the author's kids 
and their love for arena/simulation games and
the author's enjoyment of late 80's-90's RPG 
games.
